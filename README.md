Code author: Zhi-Xuan Tai

## Abstract

This paper proposes a new approach to Natural Language Generation (NLG) that aims to improve user experience and reduce the workload of customer support agents. 

It focuses on generating natural language informal summaries for online articles and posts using an offline reinforcement learning method. 

The proposed method is compared to previous approaches to text generation, and the architecture of the design, including crawling, reinforcement learning, and text generation modules, is discussed. 

The contribution of this work lies in providing a novel approach to generating natural language summaries for online content, which can enhance customer support services and improve the user experience of online content consumption.
